## My process

1. I started with the HTML markup
2. Started with mobile first approach with CSS
3. Finished with the desktop design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I actually learned quite a lot during this challenge.
  - I learned to work with grid better
  - Went with the mobile first approach which was a first for me
  - Also I worked with pseudo element `::before` for the first time
  - I also learned how to make that pseudo element get cut off by using `overflow: hidden`
But at the end of the day there wasn't all that much going on in the layout, but I did get to work with grid.

### Continued development

I need to work with grid more because that's one are in CSS that I'm not that good at.
